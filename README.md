    "# The current version of the program is provided below.\n"
    "# The execution output from the previous run is also included.\n"
    "# Everything output by the model will be treated as code.\n"
    "# Any explanatory text should be prefixed with '#'.\n"
    "# Ensure all generated output follows this format to prevent execution errors.\n"
    "# Improve the program based on its current state and execution results.\n"
